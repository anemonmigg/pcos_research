# Assessment of Various Machine Learning Algorithms for the Detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
## Dataset
The "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome" dataset that was
utilized in this study was discovered in the datasets of the online
community "Kaggle". The dataset includes the clinical and
physical parameters of 541 patients, 177 of whom have PCOS
and 364 of whom are healthy. 39 parameters total, including
metabolic parameters (9), physical parameters (16), ultrasound
imaging parameters (3), hormonal parameters (9) and
biochemical parameters (2). The patient's weight, height, age,
blood type, blood pressure, cycle duration, endometrial
thickness, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels, and
other factors are some of these criteria. The data was gathered
from ten different hospitals in Kerala, India.

## Tasks
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing
2. Train classification models to attempt to classify whether or not the instances are an indicator of PCOS
3. Assess the accuracy of the models

## Algorithms
1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Support Vector Machines (Linear Kernel)

## Classification Metrics
1. Precision
2. Accuracy
3. Recall
4. F1 Score
